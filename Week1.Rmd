This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Class Notes!!

```{r}
#Day 1 Data Viz

data <- c(1,1,4,1,1,4,1) #assigns vector to "data" object
data # <-shows content of data

```


Finding your working directory!
```{r}
getwd()
```

Set your working directory!
```{r}
#setwd(directorypathere)
```

Organizing Data
-separate folders for data, docs, figures and then script in project folder


Objects time!
```{r}

my_numbers <- c(1,2,3,1,3,5, 25) 

summary(my_numbers) #returns standard summary statistics for object given
```

Classes in R
All objects have a class in R.
```{r}
class(my_numbers) #returns class of object
class(summary)
```

Functions!
Can send results of function to new objects.
```{r}
my_summary <- summary(my_numbers) #generates objects of type "summaryDefault" "table"
```

Most of work in R is manipulating objects/feeding them to functions
```{r}
my_numbers * 2 #multiplies all elements in vector by 2
table(my_numbers) #generates summary table of items in vector
sd(my_numbers) #returns SD of items in vector
```

If not sure what something is, ask for its class!
```{r}
class(my_numbers)
class(my_summary)
class(table)
```

Also helpful to ask for its structure
```{r}
str(my_numbers)
str(my_summary)
str(table)
```

*Reasons Figures are Bad:*
- aesthetics (just uglies :-( )
- shows less than it should/could
- shows way more than it should (crowded)
- are misleading or misinterpretable (accidentally or on purpose)

*Ways to improve Figures:*
- Tufte - maximize data to ink ratio
- Avoid "chartjunk" (un needed background colors, border, frame)
- Avoid "ducks" (unnecessary kitsch)
- Cleveland - be aware of systematic perceptual issues/limitations
  - difficult to compare length judgements with no common baseline
  - people misjudge areas easily - people are better at length judgements
  - people misjudge volumes even more (why 3D charts are bad)
  - people misjudge angles. the size of acute angles is underestimated, and obtuse if overestimated
  - people find it hard to judge slopes/change 
  - comparisons cant be made if people cant see datapoints to begin with
  - colors good for distinguishing categories, but much less so when color values are continuous
  
*Working with Datas!*
Import Needed Libraries
```{r}
# for installing libraries - install.packages("packagename")
#Libraries give new functions to use
library(devtools)
library(ggplot2)

#store data url in object so don't have to type again :-) (this breaks :-())
gapminder.url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/socviz/soc880/master/data/gapminder.csv"

class(gapminder.url)



```

Get the Datas!
```{r}
#better way to get data :-) (doesnt break :-) )

x <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/socviz/soc880/master/data/gapminder.csv")
data <- read.csv(text = x)

class(data)

```

Exploring Data!
```{r}
str(data)

dim(data) #rows columns

head(data) #first few rows
head(data, 5) #first five rows
tail(data) #last few rows
tail(data, 15) #last 15 rows
```

Plotting Data!
```{r}
#Generate an object containing a plot

p <- ggplot(data,
            aes( x = gdpPercap,
                 y = lifeExp))

# Make a scatterplot (not yet assigned to an object)
p + geom_point()
```

*Basic Flow*
- Get Data
- Get Data into ggplot framework (what data is, properties of data), assign to object
- apply plot type to ggplot object to get figures

Another Plot!
```{r}
#flips x and y axis from previous
p2 <- ggplot(data,
             aes(x = lifeExp,
                 y = gdpPercap))

p2 + geom_point()

# plot new variables

p3 <- ggplot(data,
             aes(x = year,
                 y = pop))

p3 + geom_point()
```

Homeworks 

1. Create an RMarkdown file for your work
2. Look at the data again
3. Put lifeExp on the x-axis and gepPercap on the y-axis
4. Plot pop on the x-axis and gdpPercao in the y-axis
5. Plot year on the x-axis and any continuous variable on the y-axis
